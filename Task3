PROJECT: CREATE A PROGRAM THAT SOLVES SUDOKU PUZZLES AUTOMATICALLY.THE PROGRAM SHOULD TAKE AN INPUT GRID REPRESENTING AN UNSOLVED SUDOKU PUZZLE AND USE AN ALGORITHM TO FILL IN THE MISSING NUMBERS.

OBJECTIVE:
Accurate Puzzle Solving:

Implement an algorithm that can accurately solve Sudoku puzzles by filling in the missing numbers in the input grid.

Efficient Algorithm Design:

Develop an efficient algorithm, such as backtracking, that can solve Sudoku puzzles within a reasonable time frame.

Input Handling:

Design the program to accept an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input in a structured format (e.g., a 2D array or matrix).

Validation of Input Grid:

Ensure that the input grid is a valid Sudoku puzzle, with appropriate checks for initial conditions.

Clear Output:

Provide a clear and readable output of the solved Sudoku puzzle, maintaining the standard Sudoku grid format.

User-Friendly Interface:

Create an intuitive user interface or command-line interaction that guides users to input the puzzle and view the solution.

Handling Edge Cases:

Account for edge cases, such as invalid puzzles or multiple solutions, and handle them appropriately.

Scalability:

Design the program to handle various levels of difficulty, from easy to challenging Sudoku puzzles.

Educational Value:

Help users understand the process of solving Sudoku puzzles by providing insights into the algorithm used.
